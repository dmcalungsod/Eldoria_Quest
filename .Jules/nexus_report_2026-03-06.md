# 🔗 Integration Report — 2026-03-06

## 🚨 Critical Disconnects
- **Missing Monsters:** `game_systems/data/adventure_locations.json` references monsters `fungal_hulk`, `spore_stalker`, and `bioluminescent_myriapod` for the `the_undergrove` location, but they do not exist in `game_systems/data/monsters.json`.
  **Evidence:** `cat game_systems/data/monsters.json | grep -i "fungal_hulk"` returns nothing. `.Jules/nexus_report_2026-03-05.md` already flagged this yesterday but it remains unfixed.
  **Action:** @GameForge – implement missing monsters (`fungal_hulk`, `spore_stalker`, `bioluminescent_myriapod`) in `game_systems/data/monsters.json`.

## ⚠️ Potential Drift
- **Guild Halls Expansion:** Phase 5 task "Task GH.1" requires `player_halls` database collection. Logs from Artisan state "Items are ready for the `player_halls` database implementation" (`.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-11.md`), but the database schema in `database/create_database.py` lacks the collection. Content is outpacing infrastructure.
  **Evidence:** Searching `grep -rn "player_halls" database/` yields no schema implementations.
  **Action:** @DataSteward / @SystemSmith – create the `player_halls` schema in `database/create_database.py` before adding more materials to it.

## 🔗 Implicit Dependencies
- **Guild Halls Expansion:** Materials such as `refined_stone` and `treated_lumber` and Boss Trophies such as `stuffed_feral_stag_head` and `void_wraith_core_pedestal` were added by @Artisan but depend on the missing `player_halls` collection to be used.
  **Requires:** `player_halls` database schema.
  **Currently:** Database schema doesn't exist.
  **Action:** @DataSteward / @SystemSmith – implement database logic for `player_halls` before content is finalized.

## ⏰ Logging Integrity Issues
- **Future Timestamps:** Multiple agent logs have impossible future dates based on the current system date of 2026-03-06. The following files exist with future dates:
  - `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-08.md`
  - `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-10.md`
  - `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-10_DepthsWarden.md`
  - `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-11.md`
  - `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-12.md`
  - `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-12_Grimwarden.md`
  **Affected Log:** Above list.
  **Action:** @ChronicleKeeper, @GameForge, @IssueCrafter, @SystemSmith, @SkillWeaver, @Architect, @Equipper, @Artisan, @Questweaver, @Bolt, @ProgressionBalancer, @RegressionHunter, @Realmwright, @Grimwarden, @DepthsWarden – verify and ensure your system time is correctly synchronized (e.g., via NTP). This is a severe logging failure that breaks tracking coordination.

- **Duplicated Log Entries:** The file `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-05.md` contains multiple identical duplicated entries for ProgressionBalancer.
  **Affected Log:** `.Jules/agent_logs/2026-03-05.md`
  **Action:** @ProgressionBalancer – ensure your logging mechanism explicitly checks for duplicates (e.g., via `grep`) before appending to daily logs.

## ✅ Integration Health: 60%
- Significant disconnects remain concerning The Undergrove missing monsters. Content for Guild Halls is being pushed before the infrastructure database exists. Severe logging integrity failures (future timestamps) continue to undermine proper phase coordination and need immediate correction.
